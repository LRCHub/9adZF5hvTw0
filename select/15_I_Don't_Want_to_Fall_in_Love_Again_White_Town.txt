I Don't Want To Fall In Love Again
When I didn't see you today
Well, I lied when I told you the reason why
The truth is I couldn't bear to see your face
Cos I don't want to fall in love again
Yeah, I don't want to fall in love again
A wary time I see you now
I remember when I held you in my car
And your face was so soft
And so warm
But I don't want to fall in love again
Yeah, I don't want to fall in love again
You're texting as I write this song
It would be funny
If it didn't hurt quite so much
And you ask me, well
How was my day?
Well, I don't want to fall in love again
Well, I don't want to fall in love again
Yeah, I don't want to fall in love again
I don't want to feel this pain again
