We asked all our friends
Where would this desire lead?
Spoke to each other's hearts
Willed it not to be a dream
What would it take
But two in tune imaginations?
It was too late to pretend it wasn't real
When in walked love again
Cooler than you've ever seen
In walked love again
Showing us how it should be

We were sure, this time
That we knew where one another stood
Love runs it's own course
Too late to change it
If we could
Still questions came
Now we were faced with trusting danger
We caught the blame
Could we let each other go?

When in walked love again
Smiling like a lover can
In walked love again
There you are and here I am
In walked love again

My woman said: "can you take it? "
I said to her: "we can make it, yeah"
In walked love again
Cooler than you've ever seen
In walked love again
Showin' us how it should be
In walked love again
Smilin' like a lover can
In walked love again
There you are and here I am
In walked love again
Walkin' again
In walked love again
Walkin' again
In walked love again
Chasin' after you and me
In walked love again
Braver than our wildest dreams
