I am a lonely man
Sitting at home waiting for you to call
But you never did, you left me by myself
Like a dusty picture that you leave upon the shelf
A soft breath, a steamy window
The writing on the glass says I love you
As I wipe it away the water's on my hand
A lonely man, a winter's day

(CHORUS)
I will never love again
You were my only love, my only friend
I will never love again
Now that you broke my heart it will never mend
Never mend

I say, little things like the beauty of touch
I said, I need you so much
I'm living in slow motion
You are my world my picture to point
This Is the one time that I disagree with fate

(CHORUS)
I will never love again
You were my only love, my only friend
I will never love again
Now that you broke my heart it will never mend
Never mend

Two people can't always be the same
Opposites attract I feel so much pain
Tears that don't dilute the past
You made your mark across my heart

(CHORUS)
I will never love again
You were my only love, my only friend
I will never love again
Now that you broke my heart it will never mend
Never mend
