I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You've got me wrapped around your fingers
And every morning our love still lingers
I fell in love again last night
When you kissed me the way you've always done
Like the first time you were with me and my heart just came undone
Lying here this morning, boy, I know you're still the one
I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You're the reason my heart keeps beating
And every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night
We were talking about some future plans
And how far we've come together since the night it all began
Then you reached out to touch me and guess what happened then?
I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You're the reason my heart keeps beating
And every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night
In love again last night
I fell in love again last night
