Tell me, ooh
So tell me what these feelings for (What these feelings for)
And tell me who you fiending for (Ooh)
Call me by your name
Tell me you don't want to love no
More (You don't want to love no more)
That you don't want to love no more
Tell me you don't want to love no more (But you can't)
Tell me you don't want to love no more (No you can't)
Tell me that you rather watch it end (Just say it)
That you never want to feel this again
Hey, you used to call me by my first name
And life a race, but I don't really want first place
Attention cool, but have you ever felt real safe
And in my arms you can lay for like the whole day
Ay, Cold Hart Scissorhands
I'm cutting off these bitches they don't understand, me
The sacrificial lamb
I give it all up for you, but you ain't seeing that, damn (For you)
So tell me what you yelling for (What you yelling for?)
I'm with you right now
And I'ma feeling sure (And I don't wanna know)
Bust once and I'm back in (I'm back in)
If I can't get enough
Then I know you can't too (I know you can't)
Tell me you don't want to love no more
Tell me you don't want to love no more (But you can't)
Tell me that you rather watch it end (Oh oh)
And that you never want to feel this again
Tell me you don't want to love no more (You can't)
Tell me you don't want to love no more (No, you can't)
Tell me that you rather watch it end (Just say it)
And that you never want to feel this again
Want to feel this again (Yeah, I do)
Want to feel this again (Ooh, yeah I do)
Want to feel this again (But do you?)
Want to feel this again
Yawns
