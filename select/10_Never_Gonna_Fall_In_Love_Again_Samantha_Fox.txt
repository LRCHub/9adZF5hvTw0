(Phil nicholas)

Gotta get away, boy
And I'm never coming back to stay
No one ever dreamed we'd fall apart and drift away

Just another day, dear
And another lonely afternoon
After all this time it seems so hard to see it through

I'm such a fool
Believing you'd be true
It's time to get away and find a seperate groove
You know it's true

{Chorus:}
I'm never gonna fall in love with you again
I'm never gonna fall in love with you again
Oh, you've been so cruel
Breaking all the rules
Won't you turn around until I walk away

Take another look, boy

And remember what you left behind
Even though it hurts to know, you're always on my mind

Living in a dream world
It's a little bit hard to bare
Somehow I just can't believe that you don't really care

I'm such a fool
Believing you'd be true
It's time to get away and find a seperate groove
You know it's true

{Chorus}
{Music interlude}
{Chorus}

Never gonna fall, fall, fall...
Never gonna fall in love, in love, in love...
Never gonna fall in love, in love, in love...
Never gonna fall in love, in love...(again)

Never gonna fall in love with you again, again...
(Repeat to fade)
