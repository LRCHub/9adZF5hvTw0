Looking back at me and you
All the crazy little things we like to do
Stop to smile, oh, just for a while
The pictures in my mind

Will I ever see your face again?
Will we ever be in love again?
In love again, time and season
In love again

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Time spent all the fantasy
You and me, the mystery
It makes me think, oh, not everything
Is changing for the better

Will I ever see your face again?
Will we ever be in love again?
In love again, time and season
In love again, reveals the reason
In love again, time and season
In love again

In love again, time and season
In love again
In love again, time and season
In love again
Any good to me

In love again
Looking back at you and me
In love again
I'm in love again
In love again, and season
In love again
